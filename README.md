# Supply-Chain-Management


AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG(fast moving consumer Good) manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Vadodra ,Surat and Ahmedabad. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is facing issues with key customers not renewing annual contracts due to service problems, likely caused by delays or incomplete deliveries. Management seeks to address this by tasking the supply chain analytics team to monitor daily ‘On Time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery metrics for all customers to quickly resolve any issues before expanding to other cities.

The Supply Chain team has adopted a standard approach to measure service levels by tracking daily metrics for ‘On-Time Delivery (OT) %,’ ‘In-Full Delivery (IF) %,’ and ‘On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %’ for customer orders, comparing them against target service levels set for each customer.
